    <h1><b><center><u>FOOD PROGRAMME IN NUMBERS</u></u></center></b></h1>
     <p><b>According to Uganda;</b>
        <ul>
            <li>20.3% of people live below the poverty line</li>
            <li>26% of children under 5 are stunted</li>
            <li>45.9 million population</li>
            
     </p>
     <p>A land-locked country in East Africa, Uganda’s growth trajectory is vulnerable to multiple risks. 

Uganda hosts Africa’s largest number of refugees. There are over 1.8 million refugees and asylum seekers from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and other countries. 

Despite Uganda’s progressive refugee policy providing land and freedom of movement, refugees continue to face significant livelihood, food security and economic constraints. 

A volatile geopolitical environment could weigh on investment and exports, while the increasing frequency of droughts and floods heightens the vulnerability of Uganda’s smallholder farmers. 

Uganda is ranked 159 out of 193 countries on the Human Development Index, according to the Human Development Report 2023. Despite its agricultural potential and significant exports, Uganda’s food insecurity levels remain classified as ”serious” by the 2024 Global Hunger Index. This poses further challenges to the country’s ability to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2 on Zero Hunger.

According to the 2022 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey, around one in four children in Uganda are stunted (too short for their age) – a sign of chronic malnutrition. Poor-quality diets are creating health crises, undermining human capital development and jeopardising economic prosperity. 

While the country has made some gains in reducing malnutrition, the situation remains concerning – particularly in refugee reception centres and in the semi-arid region of Karamoja.

<h1>Program highlights</h1>
<h2>Active Epicenters</h2>
<p>In Uganda, there are two active epicenters working toward self-reliance. Additionally, we are implementing nutrition programs in two self-reliant epicenters. 

Oruka Epicenter is located in Nwoya District, Northern Uganda and was launched in 2022. Serving the Acholi sub-region, which endured decades of conflict, Oruka fosters community transformation through healthcare, economic empowerment and access to clean water.
<ul>
    <li>The Health Center III facility addresses common health issues in Uganda and serves an average of 10,000 patients annually. It provides a safe, local place for pregnant women to deliver. 
</li>
<li>The Oruka Epicenter Savings and Credit Cooperative has grown to 543 members, providing financial services, training, and business support. 
</li>
<li>Eleven villages in the epicenter area were connected to clean water, supporting the health and hygiene of 5,000 people. </li>
<li>Finally, our food security program at the epicenter focuses on improving market access and economic stability for its 373 members. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Fostering Youth Entreprenuership</h2>
<p>Uganda has a very young population. 77% of the people are under 35 years old. Many young people are un- or underemployed, denied access to resources and opportunity that would build self-reliance. 

To improve the income opportunities and living conditions of young people in rural Uganda, we have  developed a tailored youth agribusiness training curriculum and we are establishing youth agribusiness academies across seven districts. Through these vocation and entrepreneurship trainings, we aim to strengthen access to agricultural markets for youth and support them to build successful agribusinesses that generate sustainable income. </p>
<h2>Improving Nutrition</h2>
<p>Malnutrition is a significant challenge in Uganda. Recent surveys show 26% of Ugandan children have stunted growth and 36.9% of the population is undernourished. To address this, we are taking broad, nutrition-focused action in communities throughout Uganda.</p>

<h2>Community Nutrition</h2>
<p>Through the Global Alliance for Sustainable Nutrition, a multi-country initiative implemented in 11 Hunger Project Program Countries, we are working to ensure sustainable nutrition for mothers and children under five years old. In Uganda, the project operates in Iganga and Butambala districts, directly reaching over 62,000 community members. Mother Clubs, led by trained Village Healthy Team volunteers, mobilize, sensitize, and train mothers on maternal and child nutrition, proper childcare, and WASH practices.</p>
<p>The project has significantly contributed to child nutrition. We have reached over 29,500 children with deworming medications and Vitamin A supplements. Additionally, the initiative supports school feeding programs in several schools, ensuring children receive at least one nutritious meal per day. To sustain this effort, schools have established school gardens and teachers and parents receive training on child nutrition and WASH. These interventions have led to improved school attendance, reduced dropout rates, and better overall child health.</p>
<h2>Advancing Nutrition Policy and Practices</h2>
<p>In 2025, we are completing the <a href="https://right2grow.org/en/where-we-work/uganda/">Right2grow</a> program, a five-year project implemented in six countries to ensure that all children are well nourished and that everyone has access to optimal Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH). In Uganda, the project is implemented by a consortium of nine civil society organizations  with The Hunger Project-Uganda as the lead partner. Funded by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the project operates in 10 districts.</p>
<h2>Access to clean water</h2>
<p>Clean water is essential to creating a world without hunger. In Uganda, only 58% of the population has access to at least basic drinking water services, and just 19% have access to safely managed sanitation services, according to the WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. Inadequate sanitation and limited access to clean water increase the prevalence of diarrhea, malaria, and other diseases. Clean water enables safe food production, supports nutrition and health, and strengthens the resilience of communities to grow and prepare their own food.</p>
<p>To address ongoing challenges with access to clean water and sanitation, we are working in in partnership with Petre Foundation and <a href="https://waterfirst.ngo/">Water First</a> in Nwoya, Iganga and Amuru districts to drill boreholes with hand pumps and mini-piped tap water systems and repair existing boreholes that were not functional. Local volunteers, called animators, conduct trainings to ensure that the community is equipped with the knowledge to maintain and manage these water sources sustainably.</p>
